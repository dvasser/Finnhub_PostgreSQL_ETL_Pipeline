# Finnhub_PostgreSQL_ETL_Pipeline
In order to use this ETL pipeline you will need to import the FinnhubConnector object from my other repository: https://github.com/dvasser/Finnhub-API-Connector as well as get a free api key from Finnhub.
You will also need to download PostgreSQL (I used version 15) and pgAdmin4 (GUI for Postgres). All these resources are free and could be easily downloaded from the internet. After you make sure that all the apps are running and imported, you could get to downloading large amounts of candlestick data to your PostgreSQL database. We are extracting raw data from the Finnhub API then using the already written FinnhubConnector code to transform it into a beautiful pandas dataframe by cleaning it up. We are then loading all the info into our personal database. You will find more precise instructions on how to use the code in the .py file. Enjoy your analyses!
